VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT PROJECT.
This folder documents vulnerability assessments performed using OpenVAS and Owasp Zap to scan for vulnerabilities on OWASP web application.

PROJECT TITLE: Enhancing Web Application Security Using Regular Security Assessment 
and Adopting Secure Code Best Practice

Application Used:
 OWASP Broken Web Application

Project Overview: 
This project focused on identifying common web application vulnerabilities using an intentionally vulnerable web application (OWASP Broken Web Application) in a controlled lab environment. The goal was to understand how regular security assessments and secure coding practices can reduce web application security risks

Tools Used
a. Nmap
b. Zenmap
c. OpenVAS
d. OWASP ZAP


Methodology

a. Deployed OWASP Broken Web Application in a local lab environment.

b. Performed automated vulnerability scans using industry standard tools.

c. Identified common web and network-level vulnerabilities.

e. Emphasized secure coding best practices as mitigation strategies.

Key Findings

a.  Identification of outdated services and insecure configurations.

b.  Detection of common web application security issues.

c.  Improved understanding of how regular security assessments help reduce attack surfaces.

Key Learning

a. Gained hands on experience with web application vulnerability assessment.

b. Improved understanding of OWASP Top 10 related issues.

c. Learned the importance of continuous security assessments in web applications.
